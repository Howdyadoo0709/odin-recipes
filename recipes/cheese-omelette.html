<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This cheese omelette is great for breakfast. My wife loves omelettes
    and nothing makes her happier. When cooking an omelette, it's important 
    that you keep the temperature on the low side, as you don't want it to turn brown.
</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Salt and freshly ground white pepper</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Emmentaler cheese</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl; add milk and season with salt and white pepper. 
        Whisk until egg mixture is foamy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. 
        Pour in egg mixture and swirl the skillet, so the bottom is evenly 
        covered with egg. Cook until egg starts to set, about 1 minute. Lift 
        edges with a spatula and tilt the skillet so uncooked egg can flow 
        towards the bottom of the skillet to set. Repeat until no visible 
        liquid egg remains.</li>
    <li>Carefully flip omelette; cook until warmed through, 30 seconds to 1 minute. 
        Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese down the middle of omelette; fold in half. Cook 
        until cheese is melted, about 20 seconds. Slide omelette onto a plate.</li>
